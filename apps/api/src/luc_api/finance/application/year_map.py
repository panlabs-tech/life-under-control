"""Year map derivation (issue #102): the Bill x reference-period matrix.

Nothing here is a column — every cell derives from the Bill's effective period,
its Recurrence, the Payments and `Clock`/`Calendar` (invariant #3: persist
facts, derive interpretations).

A Bill's **effective period** runs from `first_reference_period` (where it
starts projecting) to the reference period of its closing (`closed_on`), or is
open-ended while active. Months outside it are never "unpaid": they're
`fora-vigencia`. Inside it, a month outside the Recurrence's phase is
`sem-ocorrencia`; an occurrence with no fact is `por-vir` or `vencida`
depending on the due date; an occurrence with a fact sums the splits and
compares against the **Bill's own average** (valid facts only, gap != zero)
with a +/-5% tolerance.
