"""Reference period bar derivations (issue #55): bar state atop the total-paid series (#48).

`lacuna` (gap) is the honest absence — no active Bill expected an occurrence in
that reference period (e.g. a quarterly Bill outside its anchor month) —
distinct from `fechado` (closed) with `amount_cents: 0`, which is the real fact
"expected it and didn't pay". CONTEXT.md invariant #3: a derived interpretation,
never a zero disguising the absence of expectation.
